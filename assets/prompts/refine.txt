Consider the following translation pair from {sourceLang} to {targetLang}

Context: {context}

Examples
{examples}

Source: {source}
Raw translation: {rawTranslation}

I'm not satisfied with the this, becauese some defects exist:
{mqmAnnotations}
Critical errors inhibit comprehension of the text. Major errors disrupt the flow, but what the text is trying to say is still understandable. 
Minor errors are technically errors, but do not disrupt the flow or hinder comprehension.

Upon reviewing the translation examples and error information, please proceed to compose the final {targetLang} translation to the sentence:{source} 
First, based on the defects information to locate the error span in the target segement, comprehend its nature, and rectify it.
Then, imagine yourself as a native {targetLang} speaker, ensuring that the rectified target segement is not only precise but also faithful to the source segment. 

Reply only the translation results with no explanation.
